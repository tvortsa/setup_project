<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

// FILE: .git\hooks\push-to-checkout.sample
================================================================================

#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

# An example hook script to block unannotated tags from entering.
# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.

# Setup-project модуль

помогает в создании файловой структуры разных проектов

опишите файловую структуру вашего проекта в файле setup.toml 
и запустите setup-project в папке с этим файлом.

вы также можете удалять папки и файлы указанные в setup.toml

делать снимок файловой системы текущей папки (игнорируя имена начинающихся на ".")
сохраняя такой снимок в файле grab_struct.toml

## Установка

для установки setup-project у вас должен быть установлен deno.js 2.0 +

```bash

deno install --global --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run --allow-env -r -f -n tvr_setup jsr:@tvortsa/setup-project

```

## Запуск

```bash

tvr_setup

```

если вы не положите в папку где запускаете tvr_setup файл setup.toml
со структурой вашего проекта, то будет создан дефолтный setup.toml

изучите структуру этого файла, чтобы создавать собственные файлы setup.toml
по-аналогии.

главных момента три:

1. ваш setup.toml должен начинаться строкой:

```toml
#tvr_setup
```

1. имена папок нужно писать в разделе

```toml
[folders]
```

1. имена файлов нужно писать в разделе

```toml
[files]
```

## Удаление созданной структуры

tvr_setup удаляет только файлы и папки которые записаны в setup.toml - файле

если вы не изменяли файл setup.toml после создания структуры папок с помощью tvr_setup,
то tvr_setup удалит все, что было им создано.

/**
 * Чтение /updates/:
* Скрипт читает все .js файлы в папке ./updates/.
* Парсинг пути:
* Первая строка (//src/logger) указывает, куда записать файл.
* Сравнение и обновление:
* Если файл существует:
* Новые импорты добавляются в начало, если их нет в старом файле.
* Новые функции добавляются, существующие заменяются по имени (function имя()).
* Если файла нет, создаётся новый.
* Логи: Выводит [CREATE] или [UPDATE] для каждого файла.
* Пример обновления
* Файл в updates/example.js:
* javascript
* //src/logger/log_info.js
* import { something } from "somewhere";
* 
* function log_info(message) {
*   console.log(`[INFO] Updated: ${message}`);
* }
* 
* function new_feature() {
*   console.log("New!");
* }
* Если src/logger/log_info.js уже есть:
* Добавит новый импорт (если его нет).
* Заменит log_info на обновлённую версию.
* Добавит new_feature в конец.
* Если нет — создаст файл как есть..
